# Roomies – Group Expense Management System (MERN Stack Project)

## 📋 Project Overview
A **full-stack web application in development** aimed at simplifying expense tracking for shared living situations. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) as a comprehensive learning project.

**Current Status:** Under Active Development  
**Focus:** Implementing full-stack architecture, real-world algorithms, and scalable design patterns.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
This project serves as a hands-on exploration of:
- Complete MERN stack implementation from scratch
- Designing optimized algorithms for real-world problems
- Building secure authentication and authorization systems
- Creating responsive UIs with modern frameworks
- Implementing clean, maintainable architecture

## 🏗️ Planned Technical Implementation

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** React with functional components & Hooks
- **State Management:** Context API (with Redux planning for complex state)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express framework
- **Database:** MongoDB using Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** JWT-based token system
- **API Design:** RESTful architecture

### **Core Features in Development**

#### 1. **Authentication & Authorization Module**
- User registration and login flows
- JWT token management
- Protected routes and API endpoints

#### 2. **Group Management System**
- Create, join, and manage groups
- Invitation mechanisms for members
- Role-based access control

#### 3. **Expense Management Engine**
- Add, edit, and track shared expenses
- Implement multiple splitting strategies:
  - Equal splits among members
  - Percentage-based distribution
  - Custom amount allocations
- Real-time balance calculations

#### 4. **Dashboard & Reporting**
- Visual representation of group balances
- Transaction history and filtering
- Summary statistics and insights

### **Key Technical Challenges to Solve**
- **Algorithm Design:** Creating efficient settlement calculations to minimize transactions
- **Database Schema:** Designing optimized MongoDB models for group operations
- **State Management:** Handling complex nested state updates in React
- **API Security:** Implementing robust middleware for authentication and validation
- **Error Handling:** Building comprehensive error handling on both client and server

## 🔄 Workflow

1. User registers and logs in  
2. Creates or joins a group  
3. Adds expenses → selects members involved  
4. Settlement algorithm calculates who owes whom  
5. Dashboard displays balances and summaries  
6. Future: Assign tasks, send reminders, integrate payments
