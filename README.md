# Roomies – Group Expense Management (MERN)

## 🚀 Project Overview
Roomies is a **full-stack MERN application** for tracking and splitting shared expenses among friends or colleagues during trips, events, or group activities.

> **Status:** In active development. Focused on demonstrating full-stack development skills.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Build a complete MERN stack application
- Implement JWT authentication and protected routes
- Develop complex algorithms for expense settlements
- Create responsive UI with data visualization
- Practice clean code architecture and deployment

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React, Context API, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express, JWT Authentication |
