# Roomies – Smart Flatmate Collaboration Tool (MERN, In Development)

## 🚀 Project Overview
Roomies is a **full-stack MERN platform** designed to streamline co-living for shared flats, automating:

- Group expense tracking and optimized settlements
- Contribution dashboards for tasks and chores
- Planned modules: task management, reminders, and UPI-based payments

> **Status:** In active development. Core architecture planned; no modules are fully implemented yet.  

---

## 🧾 Vision
Shared living often leads to confusion over expenses, chores, and contributions.  
Roomies aims to **reduce disputes, save time, and simplify flatmate collaboration** through:

- Automated expense splits
- Minimal transaction settlements
- Clear dashboards for task and expense tracking
- Modular design to allow easy addition of new features

## 📋 Planned Features

### **MVP (Version 1)**
- User registration & login with JWT
- Group creation, joining, and invitations
- Expense addition and splitting among group members
- Optimized settlement algorithm to minimize transactions
- Dashboard to view balances and group summaries

### **Version 2 (Future)**
- Task & chore assignment with reminders
- UPI / Payment integration linked to expenses
- Analytics dashboard for contributions and task completion
- Responsive UI for mobile devices

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. User registers and logs in  
2. Creates or joins a group  
3. Adds expenses → selects members involved  
4. Settlement algorithm calculates who owes whom  
5. Dashboard displays balances and summaries  
6. Future: Assign tasks, send reminders, integrate payments

## ⚡ Notes

- This is an **ongoing project**; currently no module is fully implemented  
- Repo will be **actively updated with commits** as development progresses  
- The project is designed to demonstrate **MERN full-stack architecture and algorithmic problem solving**  

---

## 💡 Project Goals

- Showcase **MERN architecture** and **full-stack problem solving**  
- Implement **real-world algorithms** (settlement optimization)  
- Provide **modular, scalable solution** for shared flat collaboration
